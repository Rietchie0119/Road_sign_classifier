# Road_sign_classifier
This program aims to classify a road sign using CNN. <br/>

This dataset contains 42 classes and unlike MNIST dataset, this road sign dataset is ununiformly distributed, so it's way more challenging problem. I used various techniques, such as grayscale conversion, histogram equalization, and data augmentation to tackle this problem.<br/>

The results show pretty good accuracy on both training set and validation set.

The model also outputs the correct label for test data.
